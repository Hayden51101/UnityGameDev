# UnityGameDev
A game I have been working on creating. I started by doing some online tutorials and then adapting what I learned into the game in this project.

Release Notes:

Controls:
W - Forward
A - Left
S - Back
D - Right
LShift - Sprint
RCtrl - Crouch
Space - Hold Breath

Known Issues:
If you hold your breath for 5 seconds you run out of air and "gasp." There currently isn't a gasp sound, and it just plays a footstep. The mechanic works, I just didn't have time to add the gasp sound effect. You do not need to report this in any bug reports.
The enemy always spawns in the same location. I needed to rewrite ALL of the code surrounding enemy and player spawning to fix this, so that will be patched in the next release.
Textures look really bad. This is a tech demo not an art showcase. I know the art looks terrible right now, I just wanted to get something out so that people could get interested in it before I put a bunch of effort into an art-style no one likes.
The volume slider will NOT save your choice if you restart the game. This will be patched next release.
There aren't many sound effects. I'll be adding more as the game goes on. If you don't want to hear them feel free to mute the game in the options menu.

Core Mechanics:
There are multiple different ways the enemy will chase you. These are randomized upon the level being loaded. Have fun with them!
There is currently no objective. You can wander around as much as you want and try to hide from the enemy, but that's about it. Enjoy the atmosphere and the chase!
